#### This repo has been made to host a BMI Calculator. 

#### This is a BMI Calculator that is made specifically made for adults, but it needs YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!

#### For example, perhaps try making a kid's BMI Calculator?

#### If you have, feel free to make a PR, and I would be happy to review and ***hopefully*** merge your PR and your work would feature on my website!
